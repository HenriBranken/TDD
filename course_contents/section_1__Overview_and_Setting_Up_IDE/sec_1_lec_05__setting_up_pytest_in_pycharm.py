# We have a project in PyCharm using pytest using a testrunner showing me the
# green tick indicating that all the tests are passing.

# In this lecture we have covered how to setup the PyCharm Python IDE to run
# unit tests implemented with pytest.

# 1. To select the virtual environment:
#    File > Settings > Project > Project Interpreter.
#    Select the Python executable that is in the directory you created.
# 2. PyCharm comes with a built-in test runner for pytest.
#    Need to setup a new configuration using that test runner to execute my
#    unit tests:
#    Run > Edit Configurations > Add new pytest configuration (the plus sign).
# (Lecture 6 covers how to setup pytest using the eclipse IDE.)

What are Python Virtual Environments?
1.  By default all Python Packages are installed to a single directory on the system.
  - This can be a problem if you have multiple projects that have different and potentially conflicting dependencies.
2.  Virtual environments solve this by creating isolated python environments that can be customized per project.
3.  venv's are directories containing the system's Python install and providing sub-directories for installing additional python packages in that particular virtual environment.
4.  The PATH environment variable is updated to point to the venv when the venv is activated.

Setting up a Python Virtual Environment in Python 3.
1.  Python 3 comes with a virtual environment module built-in called venv.
2.  venv is recommended as it is built-in to Python 3, creates smaller virtual environments, and is extendable.
3.  The only difference between venv vs virtualenv is the creation command:
  - python3 -m venv <VirtualEnvironmentName>
  - source <VirtualEnvironmentName>/bin/activate
  - deactivate
  - rm -rfv <VirtualEnvironmentName>

What is PyTest?
1.  PyTest is a Python unit testing framework.
2.  It provides the ability to create:
    -   Create Tests
    -   Test Modules
    -   and Test Fixtures.
3.  Uses the built-in Python Assert Statement.
    -   This makes implementing unit tests a lot simpler than other frameworks.
4.  Has command-line parameters to help filter
    -   which tests are executed, and
    -   in what order the tests are executed.

Creating a Test:
1.  Tests are python functions with `test` at the beginning of the function name.
2.  Tests do verification of values using the standard Python assert statement.
3.  Similar tests can be grouped together by including them in the same module or class.
# test_some_function.py
def test_some_function():
    assert 1 == 1

Executing pytest from the command-line terminal:
1.  pytest -v <python_file.py>

Test Discovery.
1.  PyTest will automatically discover tests when you execute them bases on a standard naming convention.
2.  Test Function names should include "test" at the beginning of the function name.
3.  Classes with tests in them should have "Test" at the beginning of the class name, and
    should not have an "init" method.
4.  The Filenames of test modules should start or end with "test".  E.g.:
    -   test_example.py
    -   example_test.py
